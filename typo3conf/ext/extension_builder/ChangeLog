[Bugfix] Fix unsufficient comparison of domain object names
Since CamelCase names result in a non underscored tablename it is not allowed to have a CamelCase and a non Camelcase model name in the same extension
They would both be stored in a tabvle called domain_model_camelcase

[TASK] Improve MappingViewHelper
In certain configurations the mapping of the record type was insufficient.
- removes also the support for locallang xml format

[TASK] Remove logging line
[TASK] Do not list "old" extensions
Since the extension builder can't convert old extensions to new ones they
should not be listed to be loaded
[TASK] Add missing language files in fixtures extension
[TASK] Fix non fully qualified typeHints
There is no way to distinct between fully qualified and non fully qualified namespaces in type hints for method parameter
So we add a trailing back slash always
Tests are adapted so all are green again!!

[TASK] TYPO3v6.0 compatibility Part 3
Enable roundtrip/edit mode as it worked before (hopefully)
[TASK] TYPO3v6.0 compatibility Part 2
Now the generated extensions are namespaced! Also a vendor name is added and can be modified in the GUI.
Edit (roundtrip) mode is NOT supported yet. (So there will be a part 3 of compatibility update)
Somehow the generated plugins can create,delete, list and show models, but not update.
I guess that's a extbase bug, since the repository update does not result in updated models.
[TASK] Compatibility with 6.0 Part 1(!)
All tests are green again. Removed all usage of deprecated class names in extension_builder.
This is called part 1 since the generated extensions are not yet namespaced!!
This will happen in part 2. This revision's edit mode should be compatible with 4.7 generated extensions!
The next revision will generate namespaced extensions and the edit mode will be only applicable for
extensions generated with that revision (or later)
Added missing arguments in Tests
[TASK] Minor CGL cleanups
- Uses tabs for indent in flexform XML
- Removes trailing space for storagePid
[BUGFIX] Adds default error styles for textareas, like inputs.
When extension builder generates the typoscript for an extension,
it includes default css that turns input elements red on form
error (class: 'f3-form-error'). This should also apply to textareas
as well. They, too, receive the error class, but the styles have
always been missing.
[BUGFIX] Fix wrong flexform reference

It should be collapseAll instead of collapse in appearance TCA
Resolves: #38371

[BUGFIX] static typoscript had wrong conditions
The condition testing only the classHirarchy was not sufficient in certain cases,

[TASK] Changed error type to warning for wrong type field It should be possible to save an extension, even if the table that should be extended has a wrong typefield column data type. (Like the pages table)
[TASK] add hint about rewritten property mapper in generated TypoScript Setup
[TASK] Fix missing type hint in Class Building
[BUGFIX] Fix generated TCA for Single-Table Inheritance
we need to use require() instead of require_once() to include the subclass
TCA reliably. I just had the case that in some circumstances, the TCA
is loaded multiple times (for example when having multiple plugins
on the same page). For the first time, the TCA is complete, i.e. contains
both the parent and the sub-class fields. However, at the second load,
only the parent class is loaded because require_once skips the subclasses
as PHP had them already loaded.
That's a really hard-to-track-down issue which we should solve in the
Extension Builder.
[RELEASE] Uploaded Version 2.3 to TER

Fields like crdate, sorting etc. should be possible as model properties.
This will result in a warning now, not in an error.

[TASK] !!!Boolean property defaults to FALSE now
To avoid error messages generated by the fluid form.checkbox view helper, boolean properties default value is FALSE now.
This might be a breaking change in case there is a distinction between
isset() and FALSE in conditions (which is no good code style anyway...)

If all actions are enabled by default, this might result in superflous action methods in the Controller and thus in a security risk, if the developer might not be aware of them
